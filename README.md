# unsupervisedLearning
BIU - 2023 - unsupervised learning final project

steps to do :
  1.setup git , 3 repositories for 3 data sets provided.
  2.get all data
  3.preprocess data (if needed)
  4.visualization of data
  5.cluster + analisys + test + predictions + outcomes
  6.ground truth , connection between clusters and ext var , outside vars
  7.anomaly detect and test to see corralation with ext var.+remove and recluster
  8.dimention reduction , visualization for vars vs clust , 
  all - use 2 clustering and 1 dimmReduce not in material .
